### Getting Started

[train.ipynb](https://github.com) is our main executable code.

The introduction of the dataset is in the data folder.

### Goal

To refine and expand upon the methodology proposed by Ali Hatamizadeh in their influential work.

We have redesigned the structural components of the proposed model.

Our enhancements better suit the complex demands of medical imaging, enhancing the model's performance and clinical applicability.
